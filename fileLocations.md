# File locations

This is a description of file locations used internally by `orfwx`.

## Directories

There are two main directories that `orfwx` uses:

* Many files are written in the working directory, especially if they are
  intended to be generated by users.
* Other internal files are generated in `~/.orfwx/`

## Contents of ~/.orfwx/

### Updated data

The data distributed through the package is updated somewhat regularly, but not
often enough for those who may require very recent data.

**updates.csv** is the latest update to that data, generated by 
`getUpdatedCsv()`.

There are other files with usernames in the form 
_updates.**yyyymmddhhmmss**.backup.csv_, where the section in bold is replaced
by a datetimestamp.
