## convert-to-package

### Intent of this branch
This branch is created to convert the ad-hoc code 
(created in the process of learning R) 
into a package.

### Intent of this convert-to-package.md
This file is intended to serve as ad-hoc documentation, 
recording intentions and decisions,
as well as linking to resources which will be helpful 
in the process of converting this code into a package.

This file is intended as a temporary document, 
which is not likely to ever be merged into the master branch. 
Some of the information initially included here may,
however,
be useful in documenting the package.

### Links

Started by finding Parker and Wickham, 
then Paulson (2016b), 
and a number of links from Paulson (2016b). 
This is currently more of a “links I have found” list, 
rather than links found to be helpful.
