This directory contains code used in the creation of tweets from the [@ORF_Weather](https://twitter.com/ORF_Weather) Twitter account.

## Status

As of November 27, 2016, 
this code has recently been adapted
from a file of functions created as I learned to use R
into an R package.
This code falls short of what I would write today,
and is far from what an experienced R user would probably write.

## Next step

My next goal is to polish the existing functions within the package.
The highest priority is to adapt them
to deal with the current dependency on variables
which do not necessarily exist in the user's R environment.
