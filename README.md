This directory contains code used in the creation of tweets from the [@ORF_Weather](https://twitter.com/ORF_Weather) Twitter account.

## Status

As of November 19, 2016, 
this code is mostly as it existed on my own computer, 
and has not yet been adapted for convenient sharing.
As this code is also from my initial explorations of R,
what is here falls short of what I would write today,
and is far from what an experienced R user would probably write.

## Next step

My next goal is to complete the transition from a directory on my main computer to a repository that can be used on multiple computers. (This is an admittedly fuzzy step.)
